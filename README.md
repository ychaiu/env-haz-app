HAZMAP is community-driven reporting tool for environmental hazards.  On a map built using the Google Maps API, users can search for a place of interest, explore hazards classified by type, and comment on reported concerns submitted by other community members.  To report a hazard, users place a marker on the map, and submit information regarding the event, including a hazard category, date and time seen, photos, and a description. HazMap uses the Cloudinary API to store and serve photos, which are rendered in each marker's information window. All new reports are updated instantly, allowing users to explore concerns in their neighborhood in real-time. Created for my Hackbright capstone project, Feb 2019.
